      <p>planetary wellbeing scientific diffusion<br> 
        <br>
        Rather than propose a more appealing way for everybody to acquire some relevant and peer reviewed knowledge generated by the scientific community regarding the planetary crisis we as a species are living and fueling, the proposal is a content filter.<br>
        <br> 
        The same way platforms like instagram, facebook, tiktok, among others filter content by different criteria such as trend, popularity, and (i'm guessing) higher level of idiocy, to showcase with higher intensity to their addicted users, a case could be made that the same filters could be enforced into this companies in a way that actually help spread intelligence rather than stupidity. <br>
        <br>
        It's allowed to dream right? Right.<br>
        <br>
        This is the filter project:<br>
        <br>
        If one is motivated enough to search for relevant information that has its foundations on facts and science, one can actually find a starting point in these mass engaging platforms. <br>
        <br>
        The problem is that, even if one curates the content that one consumes in their platform of choice, these algorithms are trained to contaminate one's content intake with stupidity on many levels. <br>
        <br>
        This is true to a person who actually tries to avoid this contaminating content. The reality is that most of us poor idiots, dont. We actively consume viral content. So the actual facts and relevant information get hidden behind highly entertaining idiots making money by spreading idiocy. And we end up using these platforms exactly for that purpose. Because we are tired of reality and just want to zone out for a few minutes (or hours (who cares?)) in some low rationality demanding content.<br>
        <br>
        Soâ€¦<br>
        <br>
        What if we could enforce a content filter that doesn't hide the idiocy, but gives it its right space in our feed page based on the relevance that this content represents in contrast to our critical environmental situation? 
        This relevance would be determined by percentage of fact accuracy and content relevance to planetary wellbeing. <br>
        <br>
        This percentage would be visually represented in the platform's interface in the form of actual size that it takes in the page as follows:<br>
