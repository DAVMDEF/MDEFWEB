      <h1 style="margin-bottom: 21px;">1. documenting design</h1>

      <p>The Design Documentation seminar focuses on the importance of communicating processes, development, research within the design discipline by not only taking documentation as a simple logistics process but as an actual tool to develop collective knowledge and build an accumulative body of thought.<br>
      <br>
      The goal of this seminar is to acquire the ability to communicate the creative process through a coherent and meaningful narrative in order to reach a broad range of interested professionals. Which has a lot of relevance especially in this multidisciplinary masters program.<br>
      <br>
    </p>

    <p>To give a concise core seminar concept statement:<br>
      <br>
      “documentation transforms design decisions into a shared language”
      <br>
    <br></p>
      <h2 style="margin-bottom: 21px; margin-top: 30px;">web page development strategy</h2>

      <p>In the first few sessions of the seminar, the main subject was to get the web page going and live as soon as possible so the group can start feeding the necessary documentation. We started from the provided template and were given different options as to how and what we could use in terms of applications and tools to develop this site, as well as basic taxonomy parameters and guidelines.<br>
        <br>
        We were given a quick lesson on setting up the repository and linking it to the selected editing platform. The default option was to use Visual Studio Code to program the site using HTML language. From a personal point of view, this was a challenge because I had at the moment minimum or close to none coding experience and knowledge, but an interesting challenge as I have the intention to learn at least the basics of coding.<br>
        <br>
        <img style="margin-bottom: 21px; width: 100%;" src="../images/term 1/documenting design/some code .jpg">

        All things considered, the decision was made to stick to developing the page using Visual Studio Code and learn to code along the way to take advantage of the fact that the repository was already linked and working correctly with this application. Now the question became: how to learn to code along the way taking into account the very limited time available because of the workload demanded for the course? And so began my relationship with Chat GPT.<br>
