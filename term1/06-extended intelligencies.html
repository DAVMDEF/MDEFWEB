      <h2 style="margin-bottom: 21px;">experience</h2>

      <p style="display: block; width: 100%; margin: 0 auto; margin-bottom: 45px; margin-top: 21px;">The seminar explored in a very interesting way the industry around AI and how it impacts our society and our world in general before getting into a technical and propositional stage. <br>
        <br>
        This was developed in two modules. The first compiled a large amount of theory in a very short time span. From a personal perspective this was a very insightful approach to the novel technology and the correct way to tackle it before actually understanding how to work with it. The theoretical section of the seminar framed the technology as it actually is. A set of tools of great capability but tools nevertheless and most importantly, a set of tools that have an immense impact, be it environmental, social, etc. It may be commonly understood that the fact that this is a digital technology doesn't mean it does not carry an environmental footprint as it requires infrastructure and energy consumption. What may not be as commonly understood is the scale of this infrastructure and energy consumption. It is important to generate awareness of this reality as a first step to implementing this set of tools in any industry.

        <p style="display: block; width: 100%; margin: 0 auto; margin-bottom: 45px; margin-top: 21px;">personal reflection<br>
            <br>
            I find it intriguing that AI has such a huge impact not only in a technology-driven-industry way but most of all in the way people have incorporated it as a standard tool for even the most irrelevant and mundane everyday “inquiries”. It is amazing to me the ability that we as a society have this capacity to interact with something that we don't quite understand, and no to say that it is mystified (which it broadly is) but in the sense that most of us don't know how it works, the process it takes to deliver what we ask of it and all the infrastructure, resources and people behind it. We as a community have come to the point of preferring to be a part of the trend as quickly as possible, no questions asked. Not even bothering to ask what this is doing. That says a lot about how we drive our societies and even more our personal lives. I find it lazy and disappointing to just accept and partake in an activity that generates so much controversy without hesitation but worst of all, knowing that is not as transparent as it seems. 
            We are very quick to criticize the use and abuse of certain products, unless it makes our lives a little easier. Then it's ok. Then it's being part of the industry. And in a way, it is. <br>
            <br>
            This being said, I do believe it is a very young technology (relatively speaking as we have learned) and it has to develop not only in the technical frame but in the regulatory frame. And for that end I think it is much better that it starts making its way into the academy as soon as possible so it doesn't degenerate as quickly as the mainstream. It is a powerful tool that can bring as incredible benefits as a society if it is developed as a tool, not a commercial product.
